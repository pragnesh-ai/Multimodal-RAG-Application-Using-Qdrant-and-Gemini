# Multimodal-RAG-Application-Using-Qdrant-and-Gemini
## README: Multimodal RAG Application for Healthcare Diagnostics

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for healthcare diagnostics using multimodal data. It combines the strengths of Qdrant, a vector database, and Gemini, a multimodal AI platform, to improve diagnostic accuracy.

**Data Used:**

* Text data: Medical histories, doctor notes, etc. (stored as text strings)
* Image data: X-ray images, MRI scans, etc. (stored as image files)

**Functionality:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Text data is cleaned and normalized.
    * Image data is converted to a suitable format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
2. **Embedding Generation:**
    * Gemini is used to generate vector embeddings for both text and image data.
    * These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the data.
3. **Qdrant Storage:**
    * Text and image embeddings are stored in separate collections within Qdrant.
    * Metadata (e.g., patient ID) is associated with each data point.
4. **Multimodal Retrieval:**
    * User queries are submitted as text.
    * Qdrant retrieves relevant text and image data based on query embeddings.
5. **Multimodal LLM Processing (using Gemini):**
    * Gemini analyzes the retrieved data (text and images) to generate insights.
    * This analysis leverages the combined understanding from both modalities.
6. **Diagnostic Reports:**
    * The system generates a comprehensive diagnostic report incorporating findings from text and image data.

**Benefits:**

* Improved diagnostic accuracy by integrating diverse data types.
* Enhanced insights for healthcare professionals through multimodal analysis.
